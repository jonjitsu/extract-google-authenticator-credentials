This was tested only with google authenticator v2.49 on android 4.4.4 (rooted) from Ubuntu 15.10. Thanks to dchapkine for providing the awesome repo to fork. 

## Directions
1. Make sure you have sqlite3, netcat (nc), adb and bash installed on your machine
1. Plug in the phone
1. Check that you can see the device using ```adb devices```
1. If yes, run ```./extract.sh```
1. If no error showed, it means it worked and the file was saved to ```./data/databases```
1. If step 4 was successful, run ```./dumpcsv.sh```
1. run ```./server.sh```
1. goto http://localhost:2001 in your browser
1. Hover your mouse on one of blue squares, qrcode is shown.
Open google authenticator on new device, and scan each code
1. Congratulations if you made it so far, your google authenticator codes are now transfered to your new device.
Before you remove your codes from old device, make sure that one time passwords generated by google authenticator are EXACTLY the same on both devices.
Note that both devices should have correct datetime set
Thank you for using this guide :)
1. Now that you understand the process, you can run ./main.sh to do all this steps in one command. Enjoy !
